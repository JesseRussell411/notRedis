# notRedis
I decided to challenge myself and write this in scala, which I have never used before. From the small taste I've had, I think I like it.


I have completed the challenge completely as far as I know. I implemented SET, GET, LPUSH, LPOP, LRANGE, HSET, and HGET

Things to know about:

### LRANGE
negative indexes indicated offsets starting at the end. So -1 refers to the last index, -2 is the second to last, etc.
